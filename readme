csv - emit loop or archive data in comma-separated-value format
Copyright 2015-2021 Matthew Wall

This service will emit either loop or archive data from weewx in CSV format.
Typically this would be done using a template and the Cheetah reporting engine
in weewx.  But this service provides the option of emitting loop data, not just
archive data.

===============================================================================
Installation

1) download

  wget -O weewx-csv.zip https://github.com/matthewwall/weewx-csv/archive/master.zip

2) run the installer:

wee_extension --install weewx-csv.zip

3) restart weewx:

sudo /etc/init.d/weewx stop
sudo /etc/init.d/weewx start


===============================================================================
Configuration

The service recognizes a few options, including:

binding - The binding determines whether the file will be updated with every LOOP packet or archive record. Possible values are loop or archive. Default is loop

filename - The full path of the file. Default is /var/tmp/data.csv

mode - Indicates whether to append or overwrite each time data is written to file. Default is append.

append_datestamp - Indicates whether the file should include a timestamp of the form YYYY-mm, so that /var/tmp/data.csv becomes /var/tmp/data-2017-01.csv, /var/tmp/data-2017-02.csv, etc. Default is True.

datestamp_format - The format for the appended datestamp. For example, %Y-%m-%d would result in filenames such as data-2017-10-01.csv, with a new file each day. Default is %Y-%m, which results in a new file each month.

header - Indicates whether to include a header with the name of each field at the beginning of the file. Default is True.

timestamp_format - The format for the data timestamp. For example, %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S results in a dateTime field like 2017-10-01 14:23:03. All times are UTC. Default is no format, which results in a unix epoch.

Examples
